# Hapkit Rowing Simulation

Arduino code for rowing simulation using the [Hapkit](http://hapkit.stanford.edu/) haptic simulation device. This code is based on the sample code provided [here](http://hapkit.stanford.edu/files/HapkitLab4SolutionsForWebsite.ino).

Follow our [project blog](https://drexelhapkit.wordpress.com/) for more information on our Hapkit assembly and simulation development.

Developed by Van Le Nguyen, Ilhaan Rasheed & Bryce Walburn for the final project in ECES-490/690: Haptics at Drexel University, Spring 2015.
